/**
 * Generic undo/redo history tracker for a Zustand store whose interesting state is a single
 * object (e.g. `project` or `comparison`) that gets wholesale-replaced on every mutation.
 *
 * Two ways to record a change, both called with the state as it was *before* the mutation:
 * - `push`: records immediately — one user action, one undo step (deletes, "finish" actions, etc).
 * - `pushDebounced`: coalesces a burst of rapid calls (typing in a field, dragging a slider or a
 *   vertex) into a single undo step, captured after a short pause in activity. Every call in the
 *   burst must go through this same function (including the very first "quiet" ones during a drag)
 *   so the "before" snapshot captured is the one from *before the whole burst*, not a mid-burst one.
